# Screenhead Arena

*Multiple people have asked me to open source this, to here it goes!*

This is the entire game source code and assets for Screenhead Arena.  
You can play it online for free on [itch.io](https://slyka.itch.io/screenhead-arena)!

I've mostly open sourced this for others to learn from since there doesn't seem to be a lot of examples out there on how to build webrtc based multiplayer games.
So don't expect too much development happening here aside from the occasional bugfix.

If you want to run this yourself please set up your own [signalling server](https://github.com/NuclearLighthouseStudios/Screenhead-Arena-Server) and change the websocket URL in the project settings. 

For local builds it uses the [webrtc-native](https://github.com/godotengine/webrtc-native/) plugin which is provided by the Gogot engine team under the MIT License.
